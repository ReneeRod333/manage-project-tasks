# Task Board


## Description

A simple project task board application involves designing a user-friendly interface to manage tasks efficiently. Users can add, delete, and categorize them into different statuses like "to do," "in progress," and "done." Implementing drag-and-drop functionality can enhance the user experience, allowing tasks to be easily moved between statuses. A clean, minimalist design with clear task cards and intuitive navigation will ensure that users can focus on managing their projects effectively.
